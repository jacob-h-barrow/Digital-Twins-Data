# Digital Twins Using Enhanced Mock Objects

## Purpose
- It can be expensive or unrealistic to test certain kinds of data.
- During my CISSP and cybersecurity masters program [2020-2021], there wasn't a good way to model a fake data breach.
  - Instead of having junior cyber analysts committing crimes to obtain "fake" data, I created CyberHerder to help analysts get familiar with mock objects.
- While studying for my PCAP exam, there wasn't a good way to model supply chain attacks.
  - The first step is to create a realistic digital model.
  - Mario's Candy Store is the start.
